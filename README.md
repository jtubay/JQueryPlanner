# JQueryPlanner

The planner takes in user imput and displays it from local storage.

# Process

I used bootstrap to help create the columns and rows needed for the display area. some basic css was used to style it. Moment.js is used to format the date. Without moment.js, the date display was only displaying in numeric form.
